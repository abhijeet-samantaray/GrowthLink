# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of different features of Iris flowers and their corresponding species.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica)

The dataset can be found in the file `IRIS.csv`.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
